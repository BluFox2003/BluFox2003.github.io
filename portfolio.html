          <h3>Be There or Be Square</h3>
          <p>
            Be There or Be Square is a 2D top down shooter that I created in
            Unity. The game is about a circle that has to navigate through a
            level to reach the end, fighting off enemy squares with weapons
            picked up from the ground. The game was created as part of a
            university assignment. This project was a great learning experience
            as it allowed me to expand further into the capabilities of Unity
            and broadened my knowledge of C#. More Gameplay shown above in the
            Video.

          <h3>Cloud Vinyl Website</h3>
          <p>
            As well as Game development, I have experience in front and backend
            web development. As part of a personal project I created a website
            for a fictional record store, using HTML and CSS to make it look
            professional and then using JavaScript to make it an interactive
            shopping site.

          <h3>Disco Dash</h3>
          <p>
            Disco Dash was another University assignment made in Unity 3D. This
            project was a group project, providing me with valuable experience
            working with a team in a development enviroment. My contribution
            came mainly in the form of C# scripting, including player movement
            and logic
          </p>
          <h3>Other Projects</h3>
          <p>
            As seen in the portfolio video embedded above, I have worked on
            numerous other projects, including protoypes for a UE5 FPS game and
            a Python discord bot, which implemented SQL and custom APIs.
